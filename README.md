# Visualize Image in Scratch

This project visualizes **10×10 pixel images** from the **MNIST dataset** using **Scratch**.  
It demonstrates how numerical pixel data can be converted into visual images using Scratch blocks.

Currently, the project supports the following digits:

- **5**
- **0**
- **4**

For better performance, the project is intended to be run using **TurboWarp**.
